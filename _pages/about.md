I'm currently a third-year maths undergraduate, studying at Warwick Mathematics Institute (https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/). I'm interested in Analysis, PDEs, and Computational Mathematics. 

During my spare time, football is what I enjoy most, and Aston Villa (https://www.avfc.co.uk/?utm_source=Store&utm_medium=Website&utm_campaign=AVFC) is the club I've supported since 2022.
